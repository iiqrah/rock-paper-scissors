# Demo Lnk: [rock-paper-scissors](https://iiqrah.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)


Hi,


So I wanted to brush up my web technology skills by coding this simple rock-paper-scissors game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.


I had a lot of fun building this and now that I have a substantial amount of work done for it, 
thought it would be a good idea to write a README.


I followed [FreeCodeCamp Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaVNP3nIAv0) to complete this project. 
The process I followed was watch a part of the video, understand it, code it on my own and refer to the video if I get stuck. 


I developed this project in 5 main phases:

- Phase 1: HTML
- Phase 2: CSS
- Phase 3: Responsive media queries + other minor HTML/CSS alterations
- Phase 4: JavaScript
- Phase 5: Create choice icons + other minor HTML/CSS/JS alterations


There is nothing more to say about this project really, pretty self explanatory.
I would have liked to be multiplayer, maybe in the future, but for now I just wanted something really simple. 


Feel free to fork, clone, submit PRs. 


Ending with shameless self promo:
